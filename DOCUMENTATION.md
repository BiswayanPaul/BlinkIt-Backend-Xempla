# Project Documentation: Blinkit Delivery System

## Introduction
Blinkit delivery system aims to efficiently manage deliveries from retailers to consumers. This project focuses on developing the backend for Blinkit's delivery system and resource management. It includes functionalities such as customer management, retailer management, delivery person management, product management, order placement, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing data
- **Mongoose:** Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests
- **JWT:** JSON Web Token for authentication

## Functionality Overview
1. **Customer Management:** CRUD operations for managing customer data such as name, phone number, email, location, etc.
2. **Retailer Management:** CRUD operations for managing retailer data including name, phone number, email, location, product list, etc.
3. **Delivery Person Management:** CRUD operations for managing delivery person data like name, phone number, email, initial and current location, availability, etc.
4. **Product Management:** CRUD operations for managing product data including product name, price, amount, associated retailer, etc.
5. **Order Placement:** Endpoint for placing orders including order ID generation, product availability check, selection of nearest retailer and delivery person, updating product stock, and saving the order details.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Token-based authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Middleware `Auth.js` is used to authenticate incoming requests. It checks for the presence of a valid token in the request headers.
- If the token is valid, the request is allowed to proceed; otherwise, an unauthorized error response is sent.
- Routes for CRUD operations and order placement are protected by this authentication mechanism.

## Error Handling
- Error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks throughout the codebase.
- Proper error messages are sent as responses for various error scenarios such as database errors, invalid requests, etc.
- HTTP status codes are used to convey the nature of the error to the client.

## External APIs
- Google Maps API is used for finding latitude and longitude based on location addresses.
- Axios is utilized to make HTTP requests to the Google Maps API endpoints.

## Project Setup
1. Ensure Node.js and MongoDB are installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`.
5. Start the MongoDB server.
6. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Conclusion
The Blinkit delivery system backend provides a robust foundation for managing various aspects of the delivery process, including customer management, retailer management, product management, and order placement. With proper authentication, error handling, and integration with external APIs, the system ensures smooth operation and efficient delivery of products to customers. Further enhancements and optimizations can be made based on specific business requirements and user feedback.
